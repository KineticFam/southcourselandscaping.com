                        <p>We start by getting to know your property—the soil, the drainage, the existing trees, how the sun moves through the yard. Then we sit down with you to understand how you use the space and what you want it to feel like. From there, we put together a plan using native plants that are right for your specific conditions.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: var(--gold-accent); margin-top: 2rem;">Why It Matters Here</h4>
                        <p>Generic landscape designs ignore what makes South Florida different: the hurricane seasons, the summer heat, the sandy soil, the salt air. Our designs work with these realities, so you get a landscape that holds up through everything our climate throws at it and still looks great.</p>

                        <h4 style="color: var(--forest-dark); margin-top: 2rem;">How We Approach It</h4>
                        <p>We work with trusted native nurseries to get healthy, well-grown plants that are suited to our local conditions. Every plant is chosen not just because it's native, but because it's right for your specific spot—your shade level, soil type, and salt exposure. Then we install it properly so it establishes strong roots and thrives.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: var(--forest-dark); margin-top: 2rem;">Why It Matters Here</h4>
                        <p>Native plants aren't just good for the environment—they're practical. Cocoplums handle salt without flinching. Live oaks are built for hurricane winds. Bald cypress love our wet summers. These plants create the shade and beauty South Florida is known for, without the constant watering and chemical treatments that exotics need.</p>

                        <p>In South Florida, mature shade isn't a luxury—it's what makes your outdoor space usable. A well-placed live oak or bald cypress cools your patio, protects your home from wind, and adds real value to your property. And native trees handle our storms way better than exotics.</p>

                        <p>We start by figuring out what's actually going on—soil issues, drainage problems, plants that just don't belong here. Then we put together a plan to transition your landscape to native species that work with your existing mature trees and hardscaping. It's not always a tear-out; sometimes it's strategic swaps and additions.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: var(--gold-accent); margin-top: 2rem;">Why It Matters Here</h4>
                        <p>A lot of properties in Broward County are stuck on a treadmill of replacing exotic plants that keep failing. Constant irrigation, chemicals, and replacement costs add up fast. Switching to natives breaks that cycle. Your landscape starts working with the climate instead of against it, and your maintenance costs drop.</p>

                        <p>Native plants have their own rhythms—when they flush new growth, when to prune, when to leave them alone. Our maintenance follows those cycles. We do strategic pruning that keeps natural form, fertilize to build soil health, and manage irrigation to encourage deep roots. The goal is a landscape that needs less intervention over time, not more.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: var(--forest-dark); margin-top: 2rem;">Why It Matters Here</h4>
                        <p>Most maintenance crews treat every plant the same. But knowing when cocoplums flush new growth, how to prune palms for storm resistance, and which native groundcovers to encourage versus manage—that takes specific knowledge. Good native maintenance actually reduces your long-term costs while keeping everything looking better.</p>
