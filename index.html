                        <p>We work with South Florida's native species—live oaks, sabal palms, cocoplums, sea grape, and more. These plants are built for our climate, which means they look better, last longer, and need less fussing over.</p>

                        <p class="lead">South Course Landscaping started because we saw too many yards full of plants that just don't belong in South Florida—struggling, expensive to maintain, and replaced every few years.</p>
                        <p>We figured there had to be a better way. Turns out, there is: use native plants that actually want to grow here, do the work right the first time, and build relationships with people who trust us to take care of their property.</p>
                        <p>That's still how we operate. We're not trying to be the biggest company in town. We just want to be the one your neighbor recommends.</p>

                        <p>A lot of landscapers use the same plants everywhere, regardless of climate. We take a different approach—we use native species that are adapted to grow here naturally. They handle the heat, survive storms, and create real shade you can actually enjoy.</p>
                        <p>It's practical, it looks great, and it saves you money on water and maintenance in the long run.</p>
