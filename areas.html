                        <h4 style="color: var(--gold-accent); margin-top: 2rem;">What We See Here</h4>
                        <p>Fort Lauderdale's neighborhoods are surprisingly varied. Coastal areas deal with salt and wind. Inland spots have heavier soils and more shade from established canopy. Some older neighborhoods have incredible mature native trees that just need better understory plantings, while newer developments are starting from scratch.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: var(--gold-accent); margin-top: 2rem;">What We've Learned</h4>
                        <p>After years of working across Fort Lauderdale, we've built up a detailed understanding of what grows well where. The little differences in soil and microclimate from one block to the next might seem minor, but they make a real difference in which plants thrive and which ones struggle.</p>

                        <h4 style="color: var(--forest-dark); margin-top: 2rem;">What Makes It Different</h4>
                        <p>The mature landscapes along Las Olas Boulevard and the Isles are some of the best in Fort Lauderdale. Many of those big, gorgeous trees have been there for decades—they're native species that were chosen well and have had time to grow into something really special. That's the approach we take with every property here.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: var(--forest-dark); margin-top: 2rem;">Challenges We Handle</h4>
                        <p>Waterfront properties mean salt air, sometimes tidal flooding, and wind exposure. You need plants that can take it. We also work with a lot of mature trees in this area—keeping them healthy, managing the understory around them, and knowing when a tree needs attention before it becomes a problem.</p>

                        <h4 style="color: var(--forest-dark); margin-top: 2rem;">How We Work Here</h4>
                        <p>In Rio Vista, we focus on working with what's already there—complementing the mature trees, respecting the architectural style, and choosing plants that fit the neighborhood's character. Whether it's a full renovation or adding native understory to an already-great yard, we keep the vibe that makes Rio Vista special.</p>

                        <h4 style="color: var(--gold-accent); margin-top: 2rem;">What's Different About It</h4>
                        <p>Coral Ridge sits a bit further from the coast, which means less salt but more inland heat and humidity. The good news: this opens up your plant options. Lots of native species that struggle near the water do beautifully here. The larger lots also give us more room to create layered landscapes with real canopy, understory, and groundcover.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: var(--gold-accent); margin-top: 2rem;">How We Approach It</h4>
                        <p>Properties near the golf course have views to work with, and we design plantings that frame those views rather than block them. We also see a lot of older landscapes in Coral Ridge that are ready for an update—swapping tired exotic plants for natives that'll fill in beautifully and keep getting better.</p>

                        <h2>Harbor Beach & Lighthouse Point</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Coastal living at its best—but the landscape has to earn its spot. Salt, wind, and storms don't leave room for plants that can't handle it.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: var(--forest-dark); margin-top: 2rem;">The Coastal Reality</h4>
                        <p>Properties near the ocean deal with salt spray, sandy soil, high winds, and the real possibility of storm surge. A lot of popular landscaping plants simply can't survive here long-term. Native coastal species can—and they look great doing it. That's our wheelhouse.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: var(--forest-dark); margin-top: 2rem;">How We Handle It</h4>
                        <p>We choose plants that are built for the coast. Sea grape, cocoplum, sabal palms, native grasses—these species thrive in salt air and sandy soil. We also design with storms in mind, selecting trees and plants that bend instead of break and root systems that hold the soil.</p>

                                <li>• Sea grape for salt tolerance and privacy</li>
                                <li>• Cocoplums for hedging that survives anything</li>
                                <li>• Sabal palms for wind resistance and tropical feel</li>
                                <li>• Beach sunflower and sea oats for dune areas</li>
                                <li>• Native grasses for low-maintenance coastal beauty</li>

                            <h4>Storm-Ready Landscapes</h4>
                            <p>Every plant we choose and every design decision we make for coastal properties factors in hurricane season. Native species that flex in the wind, root systems that hold soil during surge, and layouts that protect rather than endanger your home.</p>

                    <p class="lead">A landscaper from out of the area might know plants, but they don't know your neighborhood.</p>
