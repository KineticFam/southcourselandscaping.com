                        <h2>Why South Florida Is Different</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Most landscaping companies treat South Florida like anywhere else. They shouldn't.</p>
                        <p>Our subtropical climate, sandy soils, hurricane seasons, and unique hydrology create conditions unlike anywhere else in the continental United States. Plants that thrive in Georgia struggle here. Trees that dominate California die here. Generic landscaping approaches fail here.</p>
                        <p>But native South Florida plants? They were born for this. Cocoplums that laugh at salt spray. Live oaks that bend but don't break in hurricane winds. Sabal palms that actually prefer our sandy soils. Banyans that create the deep, cooling canopy that makes outdoor living possible even in August.</p>
                        <p>This isn't just better horticulture—it's ecological intelligence that saves water, reduces maintenance, and creates landscapes that become more beautiful with time instead of struggling against it.</p>

                            <h3>The Old Fort Lauderdale</h3>
                            <p>Walk through the historic Las Olas neighborhoods, the original golf course communities, the estates along the New River. The landscapes that have endured—that still take your breath away after decades—share common elements.</p>
                            <p>Towering live oaks creating cathedral canopies. Native palms providing structure and movement. Layered understories of indigenous shrubs. These weren't designed to follow trends. They were designed to belong.</p>
                            <p>These properties understood something that modern landscaping often forgets: in South Florida, working with nature isn't just more sustainable—it's more beautiful.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 3rem;">Why Cookie-Cutter Landscaping Fails</h2>
                <div class="grid-3">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Climate Ignorance</h4>
                        <p>Most landscape companies use the same plant palette whether they're in Arizona or Florida. Plants selected for their catalog photos, not their ability to thrive in our subtropical humidity and hurricane seasons.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Maintenance Treadmills</h4>
                        <p>Exotic plants that don't belong here require constant intervention—excessive watering, chemical treatments, replacement cycles. You end up paying twice: once for installation, and forever for life support.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Ecological Blindness</h4>
                        <p>Landscapes designed without understanding soil, drainage, native plant communities, or wildlife relationships create beautiful problems instead of beautiful solutions.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h3>The Result?</h3>
                    <p class="lead">Landscapes that look great for six months, then spend years struggling to survive. Properties that could support authentic South Florida beauty instead fighting to maintain artificial aesthetics.</p>
                    <p>We've seen too many beautiful properties trapped in this cycle. Homeowners pouring money into landscapes that never quite thrive. Historic properties losing their authentic character to trendy but inappropriate plant selections.</p>

                        <p class="lead">We don't impose landscapes on land. We discover what wants to grow there.</p>
                        <p>Every property has a story written in its soil, its drainage patterns, its existing mature trees, its relationship to sun and wind. Our job is to read that story and honor it.</p>
                        <p>This means choosing native banyans over struggling ficus. Cocoplums instead of boxwood hedges that melt in our summer heat. Sabal palms that move gracefully in hurricane winds instead of exotic palms that snap.</p>
                        <p>It means understanding that South Florida's most beautiful landscapes aren't manicured—they're mature. They develop character over time instead of requiring constant renovation.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Deep Ecological Knowledge</h3>
                        <p>We don't just know plants—we understand ecosystems. How native plant communities work together. Which species create the structural backbone. Which provide seasonal interest. How to layer canopy, understory, and groundcover for maximum beauty and sustainability.</p>
                        
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Estate-Level Craftsmanship</h3>
                        <p>Native doesn't mean wild. Our installations reflect the refined aesthetic of South Florida's finest properties—structured but not rigid, lush but not chaotic, naturalistic but unmistakably designed.</p>
                        
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Long-Term Vision</h3>
                        <p>We design landscapes that become more valuable and beautiful over time. Every plant placement considers not just how it looks today, but how it will contribute to the property's character in five, ten, twenty years.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Authentic Sourcing</h3>
                        <p>We work with native plant nurseries that understand provenance and genetic diversity. Our trees and plants aren't just "South Florida natives"—they're the right ecotypes for your specific microclimate and soil conditions.</p>
                        
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Site-Specific Design</h3>
                        <p>No cookie-cutter solutions. Every design responds to your property's unique conditions—soil type, drainage patterns, existing mature trees, architectural style, and your family's outdoor living needs.</p>
                        
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Maintenance Wisdom</h3>
                        <p>Our management programs work with native plant cycles and seasonal patterns. Less intervention, more intelligence. Landscapes that thrive because they belong, not because they're forced.</p>
