                        <p class="lead">It's not a trend for us—it's just what makes sense down here.</p>
                        <p>South Florida has its own climate, its own soil, its own weather patterns. Plants from other parts of the country struggle here. They need more water, more chemicals, more babysitting—and they still end up looking tired after a couple of years.</p>
                        <p>Native plants? They were made for this. Cocoplums handle salt spray without blinking. Live oaks bend in hurricane winds instead of snapping. Sabal palms actually like our sandy soil. These plants get stronger and better-looking over time, not weaker.</p>
                        <p>For us, going native isn't about being trendy—it's about giving you a landscape that works. Less water, less maintenance, and it looks better every year instead of worse.</p>

                    <h2>How We Got Started</h2>
                    <p class="lead">South Course Landscaping started with a pretty simple idea: there's got to be a better way to do landscaping in South Florida.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div style="margin-top: 4rem;">
                    <div class="grid-2">
                        <div>
                            <h3>What We Noticed</h3>
                            <p>We kept seeing the same thing around Fort Lauderdale: homeowners spending good money on landscapes that looked great for a few months, then slowly fell apart. Plants that couldn't handle the heat. Trees that came down in the first real storm. Yards that needed constant work just to look okay.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, the older neighborhoods—the ones with mature live oaks and native plants that had been there for decades—those yards looked incredible. They'd been through every hurricane season and came out the other side looking better than ever.</p>
                            <p>That's when it clicked. The best landscapes here aren't the ones fighting against South Florida's climate. They're the ones working with it.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="img-placeholder">

                <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 3rem;">The Problem With One-Size-Fits-All Landscaping</h2>
                <div class="grid-3">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Wrong Plants for the Place</h4>
                        <p>A lot of landscapers use the same plant list whether they're in Atlanta or Fort Lauderdale. Those plants might look nice in the nursery, but they weren't built for our humidity, our storms, or our sandy soil.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>The Never-Ending Maintenance Bill</h4>
                        <p>Plants that don't belong here need constant help—extra watering, fertilizer, pest treatments, and eventually replacement. You end up paying for the same landscape over and over again.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Ignoring the Environment</h4>
                        <p>When you don't account for local soil, drainage, and weather, you get landscapes that create problems instead of solving them. Puddles where there shouldn't be, plants dying for no obvious reason, constant headaches.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h3>Sound Familiar?</h3>
                    <p class="lead">If you've been pouring money into a landscape that never quite looks right, you're not alone. We've seen it hundreds of times, and there's almost always a straightforward fix.</p>
                    <p>The solution usually isn't more maintenance—it's the right plants in the right places.</p>

                        <p class="lead">We don't show up with a pre-made plan and tell you what you're getting. We work with you.</p>
                        <p>Every property is different. Your soil, your shade, your drainage, your style—it all matters. We start by listening to what you want and looking at what your property needs. Then we bring our experience with native plants to help you make good choices.</p>
                        <p>We pick plants that fit your specific conditions. Native species that handle your level of sun, your soil type, and your proximity to salt air. The result is a landscape that settles in and gets better on its own instead of needing constant rescue.</p>
                        <p>And we're straight with you about timelines, costs, and what to expect. No surprises.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>We Know Our Plants</h3>
                        <p>We don't just sell plants—we understand how native species work together. Which ones provide structure, which add seasonal color, how to layer canopy and groundcover so everything has room to grow and the whole thing looks natural.</p>
                        
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Craftsmanship, Not Shortcuts</h3>
                        <p>We take pride in clean, solid work. Proper planting depth, good soil prep, clean edges, and attention to the details that make the difference between a landscape that lasts and one that doesn't.</p>
                        
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">We Think Long-Term</h3>
                        <p>Every plant we put in the ground, we're thinking about how it'll look in five or ten years. We design landscapes that grow into something great, not just ones that look good on install day.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Quality Plant Sources</h3>
                        <p>We work with native nurseries that grow healthy plants suited to our local conditions. Not just any "Florida native"—the right varieties for your specific yard and microclimate.</p>
                        
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Designed for Your Property</h3>
                        <p>No cookie-cutter plans. Every design responds to your property's actual conditions—the soil, the drainage, the existing trees, and how your family actually uses the space.</p>
                        
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Honest Maintenance</h3>
                        <p>Our maintenance programs work with how native plants naturally grow through the seasons. Less mowing, less chemicals, more attention to what actually keeps your landscape healthy.</p>
